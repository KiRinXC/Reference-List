Abstract: In the ever-expanding online fashion market, businesses in the clothing sales sector are presented with substantial growth opportunities. To utilize this potential, it is crucial to implement effective methods for accurately identifying clothing items. This entails a deep understanding of customer preferences, niche markets, tailored sales strategies, and an improved user experience. Artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can recognize and categorize clothing items play a crucial role in achieving these objectives, empowering businesses to boost sales and gain valuable customer insights. However, the challenge lies in accurately classifying diverse attire items in a rapidly evolving fashion landscape. Variations in styles, colors, and patterns make it difficult to consistently categorize clothing. Additionally, the quality of images provided by users varies widely, and background clutter can further complicate the task of accurate classification. Existing systems may struggle to provide the level of accuracy needed to meet customer expectations. To address these challenges, a meticulous dataset preparation process is essential. This includes careful data organization, the application of background removal techniques such as the GrabCut Algorithm, and resizing images for uniformity. The proposed solution involves a hybrid approach, combining the strengths of the ResNet152 and EfficientNetB7 architectures. This fusion of techniques aims to create a classification system capable of reliably distinguishing between various clothing items. The key innovation in this study is the development of a Two-Objective Learning model that leverages the capabilities of both ResNet152 and EfficientNetB7 architectures. This fusion approach enhances the accuracy of clothing item classification. The meticulously prepared dataset serves as the foundation for this model, ensuring that it can handle diverse clothing items effectively. The proposed methodology promises a novel approach to image identification and feature extraction, leading to impressive classification accuracy of 94%, coupled with stability and robustness.

## 1. Introduction

With the rapid advancement of e-commerce, online shopping has surged in popularity. In this evolving landscape, consumers often find themselves inundated with abundant information regarding available clothing options. Simultaneously, retailers assist customers in efficiently selecting the items that best suit their needs. Furthermore, customers exhibit individual preferences, and may adapt their purchases to align with their clothing requirements [1].

Two industries that stand to benefit significantly from using image data, as opposed to an overreliance on manual labeling, are the fashion and online retail sectors. Instead of relying on human annotation for images, it would be advantageous to employ this technique for the automatic labeling of categories, attributes, and virtually any other data associated with photos used to showcase digital inventory. This shift eliminates individuals' [2] need to engage in the labor-intensive task of physically and mentally categorizing images.

The significance of fashion and clothing in contemporary society has grown considerably, influencing people's daily lives. The fashion industry has become a significant contributor to economic growth, mainly due to the Internet serving as the primary platform for a significant portion of the industry's transactions. Technological advancements have led to the proliferation of new online fashion websites. As mentioned, consumers are increasingly drawn to online shopping because it eliminates spending hours traveling to physical stores searching for desired clothing. With the convenience of Internet shopping platforms, customers can effortlessly browse and purchase their preferred attire from anywhere, using a mobile device or their preferred platform. Online retailers must ensure user-friendly search functionalities and provide high-quality results that meet customers' requirements [3]. However, clothing suppliers need help providing online marketplaces with precise, systematic, and comprehensive product descriptions [4], as it necessitates automated equipment they may not currently possess. Moreover, the online retail landscape is highly diverse, with numerous retailers offering various clothing types and subcategories, each characterized by unique attributes.

In the fashion industry, the concept of "fast fashion", characterized by the efficient production of a diverse range of clothing at lower costs and faster turnaround times, has become increasingly prevalent. To meet this objective, fashion companies strive to offer a broad selection of trendy products promptly. Furthermore, these businesses are leveraging technology to tailor their products to meet the specific preferences of their customers and stay attuned to the latest fashion trends. Customers can easily explore clothing items from their favorite brands, including exclusive offerings. By visualizing these brand-aligned apparel products, consumers can gain a better understanding of how new items might complement their wardrobe, thereby reducing the likelihood of unsatisfactory online purchases.

Additionally, fashion brand recommendation systems have the potential to streamline the shopping experience by minimizing the number of clothing items a shopper needs to browse before making a decision. With the guidance provided, customers can try on a select few outfits, simplifying the final selection process. Image classification is a classic challenge in computer vision, machine learning, and image processing. Deep learning algorithms [5], particularly those used for image and video recognition, have significantly improved accuracy across various domains. Interestingly, deep learning techniques are also being applied in information recommendation, with numerous recommendation systems designed to offer tailored suggestions for information retrieval [6].

Our research endeavors encompass the utilization of a clothing dataset [7] for classification purposes, the formulation of an enhanced hybrid model for accurate attire recognition, the fine-tuning of hyperparameters to optimize model performance, and the subsequent selection of the most effective model for ensemble integration. Recommendation systems [8] have employed a diverse array of methods, including deep learning, machine learning, and image processing, over the years. The primary objective of this study is to initially strategically apply fine-tuning techniques to hyperparameters and subsequently identify the optimal configuration for achieving superior performance in attire recognition tasks. The contributions of this study are:

- Our methodology presents an improved procedure for developing hybrid models, specifically focused on Two-Objective Learning, which illuminates crucial connections within deep feature correlations through the utilization of transfer learning techniques. Additionally, incorporating ensemble learning in our approach offers the advantage of enhancing model robustness and performance compared to relying on a single model, thereby providing more reliable predictions and insights.


<!-- Meanless: Information 2024, 15, 196 3 of 19-->

- After initial testing, ResNet152 and EfficientNetB7 outperform other models, making them the preferred backbone models in our proposed methodology for accurately detecting attire items. This superiority is attributed to the combined strengths of ResNet152 and EfficientNetB7 deep features, which elevate performance levels, even without the use of data augmentation techniques.

- In the realm of clothing product dataset recognition, this direct classification approach demonstrates superior performance compared to traditional CNN architectures in terms of accuracy and dependability. However, attire prediction poses challenges due to variations in style, texture, and color, making it difficult for a single model to accurately classify all items. The proposed hybrid learning method offers the advantage of combining the strengths of backbone models to enhance prediction accuracy and robustness in attire recognition tasks.

## 2. Related Work

With recent technological advancements, customers can now effortlessly stay updated with global fashion trends, significantly impacting their shopping preferences. The fashion industry has increasingly harnessed the power of deep learning and other image analysis technologies for various purposes and applications, as elaborated below. Leading online retailers like Amazon [9] and eBay [10] continuously refine their fashion recommendation engines to better cater to consumer preferences. A multitude of approaches can be employed to study customer purchasing patterns. This article concentrates on deep learning-based Fashion Recommendation System (FRS) [11] initiatives developed between 2016 and 2020. Researchers have constructed recommendation systems using either exclusively deep learning models [12,13] or in combination with other machine learning models. The article provides a concise overview of the most noteworthy deep learning models currently employed in recommendation systems (RS).

In this study [14], four distinct neural network models were employed to classify and distinguish images within the Fashion-MNIST dataset: Fully CNN, CNN, MobileNetV1, and MobileNetV2. The experimental findings indicate that MobileNet outperforms FCNN and CNN by achieving a remarkable accuracy rate of 91% in recognizing apparel images. Remarkably, this updated MobileNet model surpasses its predecessor, which attained a 93% success rate. Despite a comparatively slower training process, the MobileNet model can yield superior accuracy compared to FCNN or CNN.

Author [15] propose an enhanced method for advancing fashion style detection algorithms by utilizing component-dependent Convolutional Neural Networks (CD-CNNs). Our approach begins by gathering images of various body parts and postures, leveraging a combination of pose estimation and semantic segmentation techniques. Subsequently, study employ CD-CNNs to model fashion trends, followed by employing a Support Vector Machine (SVM) in conjunction with CD-CNN outputs to perform data classification. Our methodology effectively enhances classifier accuracy, as evidenced by the results obtained on the Hipster Wars and FashionStyle14 datasets. Specifically, our approach achieves a 76.7% and 85.3% increase in precision compared to conventional techniques, underscoring its suitability for fashion style detection improvement.

In their research, ref. [16] developed a clothing recommendation system that utilizes a programmable embedded device and a single-user photo to streamline the process, thereby saving time and resources. This innovative approach opens up new opportunities for clothing companies and advertising. The study showcases the system's ability to provide clothing recommendations independently of existing customer data, achieved through embedded devices and machine learning techniques. The system employs a feed-forward neural network for recommendations and two inception-based CNNs for predictive tasks. Impressively, the system demonstrates a 98% accuracy rate in color forecasting using AI, an 86% accuracy rate in determining gender and textile patterns, and a 75% accuracy rate in generating outfit recommendations.

During the preprocessing and augmentation phase of our study, we implemented a series of crucial steps to prepare our image data for analysis with deep learning. Initially, we standardized the dimensions of all images by resizing them to ${224} \times  {224}$ pixels,ensuring consistency and alignment with the input requirements of our deep learning models. Subsequently, to diversify our training dataset and mitigate overfitting, we employed data augmentation techniques. Specifically, we applied horizontal and vertical flips, along with 90-degree rotations, to the images. These augmentation methods introduced variations in the dataset, thereby enhancing the model's capacity to generalize and identify patterns effectively. Such robustness is fundamental for accurate classification tasks. Figure 2 illustrates the details of our preprocessing and augmentation methodology.

In the next stage of our research, following preprocessing and data augmentation procedures, a critical step involved eliminating image backgrounds to extract vital and informative features. To accomplish this, our proposed model utilized the GrabCut Algorithm [23], a robust image segmentation technique. This approach allowed us to accurately separate foreground objects from the background, thereby isolating the regions of interest and retaining the valuable, distinguishing features necessary for our task. Employing the GrabCut Algorithm proved pivotal in improving the quality of our dataset and streamlining the subsequent phases of our analysis, ultimately contributing to the overall success of our research efforts. Sample images demonstrating the application of the GrabCut algorithm can be found in Figure 3, sourced from Google.
