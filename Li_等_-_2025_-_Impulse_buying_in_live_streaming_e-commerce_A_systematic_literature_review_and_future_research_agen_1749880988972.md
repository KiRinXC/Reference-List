Live streaming e-commerce is gaining increasing popularity and is widely believed to stimulate impulse purchases. However, the literature on this topic is fragmented, lacking a cohesive foundation that hampers theoretical and empirical advancement. To address this gap, this paper presents a systematic literature review on impulse buying behavior in the context of live streaming e-commerce. Only peer-reviewed articles published in journals indexed in Web of Science or Scopus were considered. Our review synthesizes relevant findings from prior research across publication outlets, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, research contexts, and analyzed factors. We adopt the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) model as an organizing framework, highlighting the key factors influencing impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce. The findings indicate that most research has relied on a cross-sectional survey design, predominantly conducted in Chinese contexts. Many researchers have employed the S-O-R framework; however, various other theoretical approaches have also been considered, depending on the key element under study (e.g., viewer, streamer, platform, or content of live streaming). Additionally, our findings identify a range of antecedents analyzed as different types of stimuli (e.g., marketing, streamer, live streaming, and others) and organismic factors (cognitive, affective, cognitive-affective, and personal traits). Finally, we propose a research agenda to guide future work and advance the field.

## 1. Introduction

The commercial landscape has undergone a deep transformation over the past three decades, with online stores gradually replacing brick-and-mortar outlets. The convenience, diversity, and accessibility of online shopping platforms have revolutionized consumer purchasing behavior, contributing to the widespread adoption of e-commerce (Ki et al., 2024). More recently, live streaming technologies have enhanced the digital experience by making it more vivid and immersive (Bai et al., 2024). Initially popularized in gaming and entertainment, live streaming has swiftly entered the business sphere, creating new opportunities for interaction with digital consumers (Xu et al., 2023). Live streaming e-commerce, which merges entertainment with instant purchasing capabilities, has boosted consumer engagement and stimulated transactional activity (Hu & Chaudhry, 2020).

Live streaming e-commerce is thus the convergence of video streaming and online shopping in a way that combines the richness of online shopping data with the immediacy and interactivity of live video content (Bai et al., 2024). Although live streaming e-commerce originates from the integration of e-commerce and social commerce (i. e., the use of social media for promoting and selling products), it is considered a different form of online business (Ki et al., 2024). Unlike social commerce, live streaming e-commerce functions as a direct channel through which streamers present products from multiple angles using multimedia and engage with consumers in real time (Wongkitrungrueng et al., 2020). This format offers a more immersive experience than the static images and text characteristic of earlier social commerce models (Sun et al., 2023). Moreover, live streaming e-commerce is not confined to social media; as Wongkitrungrueng et al. (2020) note, it operates across three main channels: (1) live-streaming platforms, (2) e-commerce websites, and (3) social media.

Fig. 1 illustrates how live streaming functions on the Taobao e-commerce platform. During a shopping event, products are introduced, demonstrated, and discussed in real time, fostering two-way interaction between the host and potential buyers. Viewers can inquire about product features, request additional demonstrations, or seek opinions, thereby receiving immediate responses that support their purchasing decisions. The integration of purchasing links within the live stream interface, which direct consumers to the checkout page, further streamlines the procurement process. This setup facilitates instantaneous transactions that mirror traditional in-store purchases, yet are executed entirely within the digital environment.

The initial integration of live streaming with e-commerce dates back to 2016 in China (Xu et al., 2023). However, the COVID-19 pandemic significantly accelerated its adoption, as consumers increasingly turned to digital platforms for shopping, thereby fueling the growth of the live streaming industry (Han, 2022). As of June 2023, China reported 765 million live streaming users, representing 71% of the country's total internet population (CNNIC, 2023). This trend has since expanded globally, with live streaming e-commerce experiencing steady growth, particularly through social media platforms (Wongkitrungrueng et al., 2020).

In Western markets, live streaming e-commerce is expanding rapidly, reshaping media consumption and retail practices (Forbes, 2022). In the United States, the live streaming market is projected to reach approximately \$65.14 billion by 2030 (Grand View Research, 2023b). Similarly, the European market is also growing,with revenues estimated at $\$ {22.2}$ billion in 2023 and expected to reach \$83.87 billion by 2030 (Grand View Research, 2023a). Despite this growth, the adoption of live streaming e-commerce in Western countries remains slower compared to China (Forbes, 2022). In China, live streaming e-commerce is deeply embedded in mainstream platforms such as Taobao Live and TikTok, whereas in Western markets, sales are primarily driven by social media, which then redirects viewers to e-commerce platforms, reflecting distinct market dynamics (Campos, 2024).

As live streaming e-commerce continues to grow, it has increasingly attracted scholarly attention (Xu et al., 2023). Existing research has explored its impact on various forms of consumer behavior, including hedonic consumption, impulse buying, and repeat purchases (Ki et al., 2024). Among these outcomes, impulse buying has emerged as a particularly prominent focus of recent studies (Sun & Bao, 2023).

Impulse buying refers to unplanned purchases made with little deliberation, often triggered by external stimuli and emotional arousal, whereas planned purchases involve deliberate decision-making based on recognized needs (Engel et al., 1995; Stern, 1962). Unlike planned purchases, which are typically rational and goal-oriented, impulse purchases are spontaneous, emotionally driven, and strongly influenced by situational factors (Iyer et al., 2019). The online shopping environment-characterized by high accessibility and instant gratification-has been shown to facilitate impulse buying (Chan et al., 2017). Among digital shopping formats, live streaming e-commerce is especially conducive to impulse buying due to its highly interactive and immersive nature (Fu & Hsu, 2023). Real-time engagement, influencer endorsements, and gamified incentives collectively create a psychologically stimulating environment that increases viewers' impulsivity (Sun et al., 2023; Xu et al., 2023). Beyond these immediate triggers, the immersive and participatory experience of live streaming further intensifies impulsive tendencies, positioning it as a uniquely impulse-driven shopping context (Sun et al., 2023).

While impulse purchases can elicit high-arousal emotions and fulfill hedonic needs (Redine et al., 2022), excessive engagement in this behavior may lead to adverse outcomes such as compulsive buying (Sun & Bao, 2023) or financial and psychological distress (Redine et al., 2022). Given the increasing prominence of live streaming e-commerce and its strong potential to stimulate impulse buying, this review aims to examine the underlying mechanisms and drivers of impulse purchasing within this context. A deeper understanding of how live streaming features influence impulse buying is crucial for supporting companies, streamers, and consumers in making more informed and responsible use of this emerging commercial channel.

Although research on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce has gained momentum, it remains relatively underexplored compared to other consumer behaviors, such as online shopping in traditional e-commerce environments (Miranda et al., 2024). Within the broader field of impulse buying, systematic literature reviews have offered valuable insights across various retail contexts. For instance, Redine et al. (2022) examined impulse buying in both traditional and online retail settings, while Chan et al. (2017) conducted a review focused specifically on online impulse buying. While these studies have contributed to the understanding of impulse buying behavior, they have not addressed how the unique features of live streaming e-commerce influence impulse purchasing tendencies.

In the domain of live streaming research, systematic literature reviews have examined various aspects of the phenomenon. For example, Xu et al. (2023) analyzed the overall commercial impact of live streaming-including its applications in gaming, shopping, and entertainment-while Ki et al. (2024) explored the differences between live streaming shopping and traditional TV home shopping. Although these studies contribute to a broader understanding of live streaming e-commerce, they do not specifically address impulse buying behavior within this context. Despite their valuable insights, there remains a lack of systematic reviews focused on how the unique features of live streaming e-commerce influence impulsive purchasing behavior. To address this gap, the present study offers a comprehensive review that synthesizes fragmented findings and proposes a structured framework to guide future research.

More specifically, this literature review seeks to address the following research questions: 1) What are the publication trends and main academic outlets for studies on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce? 2) What research methodologies have been employed? 3) Which theoretical frameworks have been applied to investigate impulse buying in this context? 4) What are the key antecedents, mediators, and moderators influencing impulse buying behavior in live streaming e-commerce? 5) What are the current research gaps, and what directions should future studies pursue to address them?

By doing so, this research contributes to the literature in the following ways. First, by examining publication outlets, methodologies, theoretical frameworks, research contexts, and studied factors, we identify prevailing research patterns and assess whether the existing literature on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce is unified or has followed diverse scholarly paths. Second, we offer an integrated framework and classification of the most commonly investigated factors, thereby helping to reconcile the fragmented body of literature in this field. Finally, based on our review, we propose a research agenda that offers concrete guidance for future studies aiming to advance the understanding of impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce.

## 2. Methodology

Systematic reviews have commonly been categorized into three broad types: domain-based, theory-based, and method-based (Paul & Criado, 2020). Domain-based reviews can be further subdivided into bibliometric (Khan et al., 2020), framework-based (Paul & Benito, 2018), hybrid-narrative (Dabić et al., 2020), framework-developing (Kannan, 2017), and structured reviews (Paul & Feliciano-Cestero, 2021). Among these, framework-based reviews are often regarded as the most enlightening and impactful, offering the most comprehensive coverage of a topic (Paul et al., 2021, p. 337).

The S-O-R framework provides a theoretical lens to examine how environmental stimuli affect individuals' cognitive and affective states (organism), which subsequently shape their behavioral responses (Mehrabian & Russell, 1974). Research has shown that external cues significantly influence online purchase behavior (Chan et al., 2017). Given the spontaneous and unplanned nature of impulse buying, external triggers are considered central to this behavior. Therefore, the S-O-R model has been widely applied in studies of consumer impulse buying (Redine et al., 2022). S-O-R enables researchers to account for external influences while also considering individuals' internal processing and responses. Accordingly, this paper adopts the Stimulus-Organism-Response (S-O-R) framework to review the literature on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce.

### 2.1. Search strategy

Relevant studies for this review were identified through a systematic search using three approaches: database searching, journal screening, and snowballing. Initially, academic databases such as Scopus, Scien-ceDirect, Web of Science, and SAGE Journals were used to collect pertinent publications. To ensure comprehensive coverage, results were cross-checked via platforms like ResearchGate and Google Scholar. Following the guidelines of Bramer et al. (2018), the search strategy included the following keywords: "impulse buying behavior/- traits/characteristics," "impulse shopping behavior/traits/characteristics," "impulse consumption behavior/traits/characteristics," "e-commerce live streaming," "online shopping live streaming," and "livestream shopping". The search was restricted to English-language publications, reflecting its widespread use in academic research. The second approach involved a manual screening of relevant journals in the e-commerce domain to identify studies aligned with the review's scope that may have been missed in the database search. Finally, a snowballing technique-reviewing the reference lists of selected papers-was applied to retrieve additional relevant literature (Tawfik et al., 2019).

### 2.2. Study selection

The initial search yielded 447 potentially relevant documents, of which 107 were identified as duplicates and subsequently removed. The titles and abstracts of the remaining studies were screened to assess their alignment with the scope of the review-specifically, whether they addressed impulse buying and live streaming e-commerce. This process led to the exclusion of 102 papers that were unrelated to the topic (e.g., studies examining live streaming as entertainment media or impulse buying in physical retail settings). A total of 238 articles underwent a second screening, during which studies not published in peer-reviewed and indexed journals-such as conference proceedings, dissertations, or white papers-were excluded. This stage resulted in the removal of 140 papers. The remaining 98 studies were subjected to an in-depth evaluation based on the criteria outlined in Table 1. At this stage, a full-text review was conducted to ensure that the papers (1) employed empirical (quantitative) methods, (2) examined consumer impulse buying as a dependent variable, and (3) were situated explicitly within the live streaming e-commerce context (excluding those focused on other social or e-commerce activities). As a result, 51 additional papers were excluded.

To ensure the inclusion of only high-quality studies, an additional verification step was performed. All remaining papers were manually reviewed to confirm that they were published in journals indexed in reputable academic databases. Specifically, this step ensured that all included studies appeared in journals listed in Web of Science or Scopus. During this process, seven papers published in non-indexed journals were excluded, resulting in a final sample of 40 studies included in this systematic review (see Fig. 2).

## 3. Results

We reviewed all 40 studies to assess the development of research on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce and to propose a comprehensive conceptual framework. The descriptive analysis is presented in the following sections and is structured around five key dimensions: (1) publication outlets, (2) research contexts, (3) theoretical frameworks, (4) research approaches and methods, and (5) factors examined. To provide a more organized interpretation of the identified factors, they are categorized according to the S-O-R framework.

### 3.1. Publication outlets

The first study on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce was published in 2020 (Gong et al., 2020), marking the onset of academic interest in this emerging field. Since then, as shown in Fig. 3, the number of studies has steadily increased. To illustrate, 12 papers were published in the first seven months of 2024-matching the total for 2022 and only three fewer than in 2023. Overall, the reviewed studies were published across 28 different publication outlets (see Table 2), reflecting the multidisciplinary nature of this topic. The journals with the highest number of publications are the Journal of Retailing and Consumer Services and Frontiers in Psychology $\left( {\mathrm{n} = 5\text{each}}\right)$ ,indicating a strong focus on both the psychological and retail perspectives in the study of impulse buying during live streaming e-commerce.

### 3.2. Research context

As previously noted, live streaming e-commerce can occur across various online channels, including social media, e-commerce platforms, and dedicated websites. However, most of the reviewed studies did not specify the particular platform or channel examined. Among those that did, three studies identified Taobao (e.g., Lou et al., 2022), China's largest e-commerce platform. One study focused on TikTok (Razafinandrasana & Tamara, 2024), while another one cited short-video platforms as the research setting (Zhang et al., 2024). Originally developed as social media, short-video platforms have increasingly integrated e-commerce functionalities, thereby blurring the boundaries between social and e-commerce platforms.

Regarding sample origin, a few studies did not report this information (e.g., Lin et al., 2023). However, among those that did, a clear trend emerges: 31 out of the 40 reviewed studies focused on China, highlighting the country's central role in the development and adoption of live streaming e-commerce. Additionally, seven studies extended their scope to other Asian regions (e.g., Pham et al., 2023), and one study employed a multi-country Asia-Pacific sample (Yang et al., 2022). Beyond geographic origin, two studies examined specific audience segments: Luo et al. (2024) targeted millennial shoppers, while Pham et al. (2023) focused on young Vietnamese consumers. In terms of industry focus, there is limited specialization, as most studies do not reference a specific industry or product category. However, a few exceptions exist. For example, Ye et al. (2022) examined the philanthropic sector; Alam et al. (2023) and Liang et al. (2024) focused on the tourism industry; and Liu et al. (2024) investigated cross-border live streaming e-commerce in Malaysia.

### 3.3. Theoretical frameworks

A wide range of theories has been employed to explain why impulse buying emerges in the context of live streaming e-commerce. These theories can be categorized based on their focus on different perspectives for understanding impulse buying: viewer, streamer, platform, and content (see Table 3). The S-O-R framework serves as a unifying foundation, linking elements from different theories. Following this, theories related to streamer, platform, and content can be classified as stimulus-oriented, as they seek to explain how different types of external stimuli trigger impulse buying. In contrast, theories focusing on the viewer perspective align with the organism component of the S-O-R model, aiming to unravel the internal cognitive and emotional processes that lead to impulsive purchase behavior.

Unsurprisingly, our literature review reveals that two-thirds of the studies have adopted S-O-R as their theoretical foundation. As previously discussed, this framework is particularly well-suited to explaining the influence of multiple environmental cues in online impulse buying contexts, such as live streaming e-commerce (Chan et al., 2017; Huang, 2016).

#### 3.3.1. Viewer

The broad range of theoretical frameworks focusing on the viewer reflects a strong scholarly interest in understanding why specific stimuli trigger impulse buying. In this context, theories such as Self-Determination Theory (SDT) and Cognitive Emotion Theory offer valuable insights into how viewers' motivations and emotional states influence their impulse buying behavior during live streaming e-commerce. SDT highlights how both intrinsic and extrinsic motivations drive viewer engagement. For example, viewers may be motivated by the enjoyment of discovering a new product or by the desire for social recognition through participation in live chats. These intrinsic motivations can increase viewer interaction and, in turn, contribute to impulse buying decisions (Gong et al., 2020; Nguyen-Viet & Nguyen, 2024). Similarly, Cognitive Emotion Theory emphasizes the role of emotional responses in shaping consumer behavior (Nyer, 1997). In the live streaming context, streamers can elicit strong emotional reactions in viewers through persuasive communication strategies, which can significantly heighten the likelihood of impulse buying (Alam et al., 2023; Li, Huang, et al., 2024).

#### 3.3.2. Streamer

Given the prominent role of streamers or anchors in live streaming e-commerce, several theories have been proposed to explain how these stimuli influence viewers' emotional and behavioral responses. Trust Theory, for example, outlines a progression from cognitive trust-where viewers evaluate the streamer's competence and reliability-to affective trust, an emotional bond that significantly enhances impulsive purchase intentions (Chen et al., 2024). In addition, Affective Distance Theory emphasizes the importance of reducing emotional distance between the streamer and the viewer. A closer affective distance strengthens trust, leading viewers to perceive the streamer as more authentic, which in turn increases the likelihood of impulsive buying behavior (Chen et al., 2024).

#### 3.3.3. Platform

Another set of theories has focused on how live streaming platforms influence viewers' impulse buying. Several studies have employed Social Presence Theory and Uses and Gratification Theory (UGT) to explore these dynamics. According to Social Presence Theory, compared to traditional media, live streaming platforms enhance the sense of social presence and reduce the perceived distance between streamers and online consumers (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). UGT, on the other hand, investigates how viewers actively engage with live streaming platforms to satisfy specific needs, such as entertainment, information, or social interaction (Liu et al., 2024). For example, Deng et al. (2023) applied UGT to examine how consumer characteristics shape the use of live streaming e-commerce platforms for fulfilling social needs. Their findings revealed that parasocial interaction positively influenced impulse purchases and mediated the relationship between consumer traits and impulse buying behavior.

#### 3.3.4. Content

The Elaboration Likelihood Model (ELM) and Aristotle's Rhetorical Appeals provide useful perspectives on how content presentation influences viewer perceptions and enhances impulse buying (Chen et al., 2024; Shao, 2023). Developed by Petty and Cacioppo (1986), ELM is a dual-process theory that explains how individuals process persuasive messages through two distinct routes: the central route and the peripheral route. The central route involves careful and thoughtful evaluation of the message content, leading to attitude changes based on the quality of the arguments. In contrast, the peripheral route relies on superficial cues-such as the communicator's attractiveness or the emotional appeal of the message-resulting in more temporary attitude shifts. In the context of impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce, ELM has been applied to assess factors influencing impulse purchase behavior through both routes: the central route, including factors such as product information quality, streamer interaction quality, and streamer credibility, and the peripheral route, involving cues like review consistency and emotional contagion (Luo et al., 2024).

### 3.4. Research approaches and methods

The most commonly employed methodology among the reviewed studies was quantitative surveying. However, mixed-methods approaches have also been adopted to enrich the findings. For instance, Yan et al. (2022) combined quantitative survey data with qualitative insights obtained from semi-structured interviews conducted with a subset of participants. Similarly, Miranda et al. (2024) integrated questionnaire data with a content analysis of a well-known Chinese streamer. Experimental research was notably scarce, with only one study (Kong et al., 2023) examining the interactive effects of time pressure and product type on impulse buying.

In terms of statistical analysis, the majority of studies relied on structural equation modeling (SEM) (e.g., Lee & Chen, 2021; Zhang et al., 2024). Nonetheless, some studies employed multiple regression analysis (e.g., Sun et al., 2023), or a combination of SEM and regression techniques (e.g., Li et al., 2022), reflecting some diversity in analytical strategies.

### 3.5. Factors organized according to the S-O-R framework

Throughout our review, we analyzed the factors examined in the selected studies and organized them according to the S-O-R framework to enhance understanding and provide a comprehensive overview of impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce (see Fig. 4). The S-O-R model facilitates the integration of diverse theoretical perspectives by categorizing constructs into stimuli (external triggers), organism (internal processes), and response (behavioral outcomes). This approach offers an integrative and structured framework for our analysis. Table 4 presents a classification of the constructs identified in the reviewed studies, mapped to their corresponding S-O-R categories.

#### 3.5.1. Stimulus

Previous studies have commonly distinguished between system-related stimuli-associated with the platform- and marketing-related stimuli (Miranda et al., 2024). However, given the central role of the streamer as an intermediary between the platform and the viewer in the live streaming e-commerce context (Li, Huang, et al., 2024), some scholars have proposed the streamer as a distinct third category of stimulus within this environment (Chen et al., 2022). Building on this perspective, our literature review supports the differentiation of stimuli into marketing, platform, and streamer-related categories. Additionally, we propose an 'other' stimuli category to capture factors that fall outside the first three domains (e.g., Luo et al., 2024; Zhang, Cheng, & Huang, 2022).

3.5.1.1. Marketing mix. A wide range of marketing-related factors has been examined in the context of live streaming e-commerce. Among these, promotions have been shown to stimulate impulse buying by enhancing flow experience and appealing to consumers' psychological drive for affordable prices (Huo et al., 2023). Time pressure is another influential factor, as consumers are more prone to make impulsive purchases under time constraints (Cui et al., 2022). Scarcity appeals, which leverage the perception that limited-availability products are more valuable, have also been studied. Research suggests that scarcity can enhance impulse buying both directly (Chen et al., 2022a) and indirectly through increased consumer involvement, enjoyment, and perceived usefulness (Gong & Jiang, 2023; Miranda et al., 2024). While product price is a relevant factor in impulsive buying (Hosseini et al., 2020), some evidence indicates that consumers tend to be less price-sensitive in live streaming environments (Lee & Chen, 2021). Additionally, personalized recommendations-a more advanced form of marketing stimulus-have been found to reduce cognitive load during the decision-making process, thereby accelerating purchasing decisions and increasing the likelihood of impulse buying (Cui et al., 2022).

Within the marketing mix, product-related stimuli have attracted particular scholarly attention. For instance, Lee and Chen (2021) found that product usefulness influences impulse buying indirectly through perceived enjoyment. Similarly, Lou et al. (2022) explored the connection between product popularity and perceived competition, showing that the latter can trigger impulse purchase behavior. Gong and Jiang (2023) examined the impact of product design on product involvement, revealing that functional design affects cognitive but not affective involvement. Furthermore, quality perception was shown to positively influence both cognitive and affective involvement, thereby increasing the propensity for impulse buying (Gong & Jiang, 2023).

3.5.1.2. Live streaming. Factors related to live streaming characteristics emerged as the most consistently cited in our literature review. Among these, interaction and atmospheric cues are particularly prominent. Interaction is a defining feature of live streaming e-commerce, one that largely affects impulse buying (Li et al., 2024). It is often seen as a means of recreating the in-store shopping experience, thereby enhancing feelings of attachment and reinforcing social presence (Huang et al., 2024; Liang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024; Nguyen-Viet & Nguyen, 2024), consumer's sense of fun, trust, emotional investment, emotional arousal and happiness (Alam et al., 2023; Liang et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2023)- all of which are linked to increased impulse purchasing.

Atmospheric cues refer to the visual and auditory elements used to convey information within the live streaming platform. One key attribute is vividness-number of sensory cues that the platform can appeal to-which has been identified as a significant antecedent of impulse buying (Alam et al., 2023; Huu et al., 2023). In addition to sensory appeal, the accuracy and usefulness of information presented during the stream play a crucial role in satisfying consumers' informational needs and building trust in the product (Huang et al., 2024). When consumers perceive the information as useful, the likelihood of impulse purchases increases (Liu et al., 2024).

Yang et al. (2022) introduced the concept of interface design, which integrates both aesthetic and functional elements of the live streaming environment. A well-designed interface enhances visual appeal and stimulates consumer arousal, both of which can lead to unplanned purchases. Similarly, Cui et al. (2022) found that website design and product information spillover contribute to creating a more immersive experience, further encouraging impulsive buying behavior. Beyond informative cues, entertainment and playfulness also play a vital role in shaping impulse buying tendencies. Engaging and entertaining content has been shown to heighten the consumer experience and increase the likelihood of impulsive purchases (Lin et al., 2023; Yan et al., 2022).

Another important stimulus is social presence, commonly defined as the extent to which a platform can convey human-like feelings and interpersonal warmth (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). While some scholars classify social presence within the organism component of the S-O-R framework (e.g., Liang et al., 2024; Shi et al., 2023), the majority of studies conceptualize it as a stimulus indirectly influencing impulse buying (Li et al., 2022, 2023; Ming et al., 2021). Convenience is also a potential indirect driver of impulse purchases, as it reduces friction in the decision-making process and enhances the overall consumer experience (Lee & Chen, 2021; Lin et al., 2023). Collectively, these findings underscore how live streaming environments can be designed to enhance impulse buying.

3.5.1.3. Streamer. The stimulation provided by streamers can significantly influence the internal state of consumers and lead to impulse purchases (Yan et al., 2022). Research has shown that when viewers form a positive overall evaluation of the streamer, the likelihood of impulsive buying increases (Chen et al., 2022a; Zhang et al., 2024). As a result, many studies have focused on analyzing specific streamer traits. Among these, attractiveness may capture consumer attention and positively influence impulse buying (Huang et al., 2024; Ye et al., 2022). Other streamer traits, such as expertise (Li, Huang, et al., 2024; Shao, 2023) and popularity (Li et al., 2024; Lou et al., 2022), have also shown consistent indirect positive effects on impulse purchasing. However, the role of credibility or trustworthiness presents more mixed findings. Some studies report a positive indirect relationship between streamer credibility and impulse buying (Luo et al., 2024), while others report inconclusive (Yan et al., 2022) or non-significant effects (Lee & Chen, 2021; Ye et al., 2022). Additionally, streamer-related factors such as charm, reputation, and presentation style have been found to shape consumer evaluations, which in turn influence impulse buying behavior (Chen et al., 2024; Nguyen-Viet & Nguyen, 2024).

3.5.1.4. Other factors. Several studies have identified additional factors as independent variables associated with impulse buying in the context of live streaming e-commerce. For example, Lin et al. (2023) examined the role of demand in shaping consumer behavior. Their findings indicate that demand operates as a strong external stimulus enhancing perceived enjoyment, which in turn increases impulse purchase intentions (Lin et al., 2023). In contrast, Deng et al. (2023) explored the behavioral effects of viewer-based (or internal) stimuli, including empathy, loneliness, real-life social avoidance, and mutual assistance. Surprisingly, loneliness-despite its expected role in enhancing engagement with live streaming-was found not to significantly influence impulse buying. A more comprehensive overview of these and other constructs is provided in Table 4.

#### 3.5.2. Organism

Beyond the influence of external stimuli, many studies have emphasized the role of psychological factors as direct drivers of impulsive buying behavior. These factors often act as mediators, as argued by the S-O-R framework, translating external stimuli into impulsive purchasing actions. Our literature review identified a diverse range of organism-related factors, which can be categorized based on their cognitive or affective nature, as well as whether they reflect more stable personality traits.

3.5.2.1. Cognitive factors. The reviewed studies examined the role of various cognitive factors, identifying them as mediators through which stimuli influence impulse buying. Notable cognitive constructs include psychological ownership of products showcased during the live stream session (Gong et al., 2020; Huu et al., 2023), involvement (Chen et al., 2022b; Gong & Jiang, 2023), and perceived competition (Lou et al., 2022) (see Table 4). Utilitarian value and perceived usefulness have emerged as particularly prominent mediators in live streaming e-commerce. Fu and Hsu (2023) emphasized that utilitarian value plays a central role in driving impulsive purchases, often surpassing hedonic motivations in live streaming environments. Real-time interaction with streamers enhances consumers' utilitarian attitudes, leading to a stronger impulse to buy (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). In terms of perceived usefulness, Pham et al. (2023) demonstrated that social interaction and app brand equity can increase perceived usefulness, which subsequently promote impulsive buying behavior. Furthermore, perceived ease of use not only influences purchase intentions directly but also enhances usefulness and enjoyment, thereby amplifying the likelihood of impulsive purchases. Conversely, perceived risk has been shown to negatively affect impulse buying by undermining key mediators such as perceived usefulness (Wu et al., 2020). However, Zhang, Zhang, and Wang (2022) argued that in the highly interactive environment of live streaming e-commerce, social presence can mitigate perceived risk, diminishing its impact on impulse buying behavior.

3.5.2.2. Affective effects. Affective factors are widely recognized as key mediators in the relationship between external stimuli and impulse buying (Feng et al., 2024; Miranda et al., 2024). Lin et al. (2023) emphasized the role of perceived enjoyment as a central organismic construct, translating interactivity and playfulness into impulsive purchase behavior. As a hedonic response, perceived enjoyment increases the likelihood of impulse buying by enhancing the emotional appeal of the shopping experience (Huang et al., 2024; Liu et al., 2024). The experience of flow state-characterized by deep immersion and enjoyment-has also been shown to increase platform engagement and raise the probability of impulse purchases (Huo et al., 2023; Li, Huang, et al., 2024; Ming et al., 2021). Li, Kang, et al. (2023) further identified perceived value and positive affect as important mediators linking creative stimuli to impulse buying intentions. Another important dimension is affective distance between consumers and streamers, which influences trust generation-a critical factor in impulse buying (Chen et al., 2024). Additional affective constructs, such as pleasure and arousal, have also been shown to significantly impact impulse purchases (Alam et al., 2023; Li et al., 2022). Further studies examining a range of affective factors can be found in Table 4.

3.5.2.3. Cognitive - affective effects. A third set of organism-related factors can be considered both cognitive and affective in nature.

Among these, trust has received the most scholarly attention, consistently identified as a key antecedent of impulse buying (Ming et al., 2021; Zhang, Cheng, & Huang, 2022). Trust influences consumer behavior by reducing perceived risk and enhancing comfort, thereby

facilitating impulsive purchases during the live stream (Li, Huang, et al., 2024). Other dual-character constructs, such as consumer engagement (Luo et al., 2024; Yang et al., 2022) and attitudes toward live streaming (Liu et al., 2024), have also been found to positively impact impulse buying by fostering emotional connection and increasing cognitive involvement.

3.5.2.4. Personality traits. Beyond cognitive and affective evaluations triggered by different types of stimuli, researchers have also explored the mediating role of personality traits in impulse buying. Existing findings indicate that traits such as self-efficacy (Gong et al., 2020), vulnerability (Zhang et al., 2024), susceptibility to social influence (Feng et al., 2024), and impulse buying tendency or urge to consume impulsively (Alam et al., 2023; Qu et al., 2023) are positively associated with impulsive purchase behavior. In contrast, the Zhong Yong tendency-a cultural disposition toward moderation, harmony, and balance-has been found to attenuate the effects of external stimuli and thereby reduce the likelihood of impulse buying (Gao et al., 2022).

#### 3.5.3. Response

A response refers to the consumer's reaction to live-streaming e-commerce stimuli, shaped by the organism's internal evaluation. In the context of this review-focused on impulse buying-a relatively diverse range of response-related constructs has been examined. Most studies use impulse buying behavior (Huang et al., 2024; Huo et al., 2023) or more generally impulse buying (Liu et al., 2024; Miranda et al., 2024) as the dependent variable, often with context-specific measures (e.g., the tourism sector in Alam et al., 2023). Impulse buying is typically defined as a spontaneous, unplanned purchase made "in the heat of the moment", capturing the culmination of impulsive tendencies; it is commonly measured through self-reported behavior (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). Some studies, however, assess impulse buying intention rather than behavior (Chen et al., 2024; Lin et al., 2023). A noteworthy number of works have also investigated the urge to buy impulsively, which refers to the immediate desire or compulsion to make unplanned purchases in response to live-streaming stimuli (Feng et al., 2024; Fu & Hsu, 2023). This construct reflects the emotional intensity of the shopping experience and has been described as a key precursor to actual impulsive behavior (Lee & Chen, 2021).

#### 3.5.4. Moderators

Beyond the traditional components of the S-O-R framework, our review identified the presence of moderating variables in nearly half of the studies analyzed, providing a deeper understanding of the conditions under which stimuli influence consumer responses. Broadly, these moderators can be grouped into four main categories-evaluation, regulation, engagement, and individual differences. A detailed overview of the moderators included in each category is presented in Table 5.

3.5.4.1. Evaluation. Consumers' evaluation of product-related stimuli is influenced by their cognitive capacities and information-processing abilities (Bettman, 1979). Individuals with a high need for cognition process information more deeply, which often reduces the spontaneity of their decisions (Cacioppo et al., 1996). In live streaming e-commerce, the need for cognition determines the level of stimulation required to trigger an impulse purchase (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). Those with a higher need for cognition tend to require more complex content or detailed information to engage in impulse buying, highlighting the critical role of cognitive depth in the assessment process (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023). In addition, price perception has been found to significantly moderate the relationship between the urge to buy impulsively and actual impulse buying behavior. Specifically, higher prices lead consumers to engage in more deliberate evaluations, whereas lower prices are more likely to facilitate impulse purchases (Feng et al., 2024).

In the same vein, product type plays a moderating role in how external stimuli are translated into impulse buying behavior during the consumer evaluation process. The way consumers acquire and process product information depends on the inherent characteristics of the product type (Nelson, 1970). Both Kong et al. (2023) and Zhang et al. (2024) found that search products-due to their information transparency and standardization-are more likely to elicit impulsive responses when consumers are exposed to external stimuli such as time pressure and vulnerability.

Perceived power enhances consumers' confidence in their purchase decisions, making them more susceptible to persuasive cues (Lou et al., 2022; Ming et al., 2021). Additionally, regulatory focus plays a key role in decision-making speed: consumers with a promotion focus tend to make faster impulse purchases, particularly under time constraints (Kong et al., 2023). Emotional states also act as moderators in the evaluation process: negative emotions generally reduce impulse buying by heightening perceived risk, while positive emotions increase susceptibility to persuasion and thus facilitate faster purchasing decisions (Sun et al., 2023).

3.5.4.2. Regulation. Loss of self-control has long been recognized as a key driver of impulse spending (Baumeister, 2002). Accordingly, traits such as impulsivity, deal-proneness, and the availability of time and money are expected to intensify the impact of live streaming stimuli, making it easier for consumers to lose self-regulation and engage in impulsive buying (Huo et al., 2023). Impulsive consumption tendency influences how emotional and cognitive responses during live streaming sessions convert into purchasing behavior (Alam et al., 2023). Consumers high in impulsivity tend to be more receptive to external stimuli, which accelerates impulsive purchase decisions (Huu et al., 2023). Deal proneness, or sensitivity to promotions and discounts, has also been shown to enhance the transformation of customer engagement into impulse purchases (Luo et al., 2024). Similarly, scarcity persuasion-- through cues signaling product value, exclusivity, or limited availability-increases urgency and the likelihood of making an impulsive purchase during live streams (Feng et al., 2024). Moreover, time and money availability both reduce cognitive load, enabling consumers to engage in impulse buying (Huo et al., 2023). In live streaming environments, having more available time supports a sustained flow experience, which deepens immersion and lowers resistance to impulsive behavior. Financial security also reduces perceived risk, weakening the need for self-control and making impulse buying more likely (Huo et al., 2023).

3.5.4.3. Engagement. In live streaming contexts, viewer engagement has been identified as a moderator in the process of emotional contagion, attenuating some of the effects attributed to streamer influence (Li et al., 2024). Additionally, celebrity endorsements have been found to enhance social presence and facilitation, thereby increasing the likelihood of impulsive decision-making (Li, Dou, & Yu, 2023).

3.5.4.4. Individual differences. Two studies have examined gender as a moderating variable in impulse buying behavior during live streaming e-commerce. Huang et al. (2024) found that women exhibit higher levels of emotional and cognitive impulsivity, resulting in more frequent impulse purchases. In contrast, Fu and Hsu (2023) observed that the relationship between hedonic value and impulse buying was stronger among women, while utilitarian value had a greater influence on men's impulse buying decisions. The authors also noted that prior shopping experience significantly moderates the pathway from both hedonic and utilitarian value to impulse purchases, highlighting the role of consumer experience in shaping impulsive buying behavior (Fu & Hsu, 2023).

## 4. Discussion and future research directions

Impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce is currently a burgeoning area of academic research. This review synthesizes findings from 40 peer-reviewed studies, revealing that although the field is relatively nascent, it is experiencing accelerated development. Research in this area spans multiple disciplines, with particularly strong contributions from information management, e-commerce, marketing, psychology, and multidisciplinary journals. Consistent with broader impulse buying literature, the S-O-R framework dominates the theoretical landscape. However, a range of alternative frameworks has also been employed, especially in studies focusing on the viewer perspective, or on specific types of stimuli such as the streamer, platform, or content. From a methodological standpoint, the majority of studies utilize online questionnaires and apply SEM analysis, typically using Chinese consumer samples. Greater diversity emerges in the factors analyzed, particularly across the stimulus and organism dimensions, with most variables found to exert a positive influence on impulse buying. An additional noteworthy trend is the number of studies incorporating moderating variables, which offer more nuanced insights into the dynamics of impulse purchasing in live streaming contexts. Based on these findings, the next sections outline our contributions and propose a future research agenda to guide the continued development of this field.

### 4.1. Contributions of the study

This study organizes and expands current knowledge on impulse buying within the context of live streaming e-commerce, offering several key contributions. First, responding to recent calls for further research in this area (Miranda et al., 2024), we conducted a systematic review of 40 peer-reviewed studies, identifying the primary publication outlets, research contexts, theoretical frameworks, methodologies, and factors analyzed. This mapping revealed areas of diversity, particularly in the range of factors studied, alongside areas of convergence, such as the predominant use of survey-based methodologies. These findings provide future researchers with a clearer understanding of underexplored aspects and highlight potential opportunities for advancing the field. Second, our review enabled the development of an integrative theoretical model grounded in the S-O-R framework. While S-O-R remains the dominant lens in the field, we contribute by offering a structured classification of prior research according to the nature of the stimuli-streamer, platform, or content-and their relation to viewer-based (organism) constructs (see Fig. 5). This framework allows for the alignment of theoretical approaches and empirical variables, offering researchers a guide for theory selection and model building. Specifically, scholars may choose to explore comprehensive models that examine interactions across multiple stimulus types or focus on individual elements for more granular insights into their influence on impulse behavior. Finally, by synthesizing existing findings, we identify a number of research gaps, including areas where evidence remains scarce or inconclusive. These insights form the basis of our proposed research agenda, which aims to direct scholarly attention toward promising avenues for future investigation, ultimately strengthening theoretical and empirical understanding in this emerging field.

### 4.2. Future research directions

As previously noted, the systematic literature review revealed several notable research gaps. One of the most prominent limitations concerns the geographical concentration of empirical studies: the vast majority of research relies on samples from China. While this is understandable given China's pioneering role and expansive development of live streaming e-commerce, it limits the generalizability of findings to other national or cultural contexts (Shi et al., 2023). To address this and other gaps, we structured our future research agenda using the Theor-y-Context-Characteristics-Methodology (TCCM) framework as proposed by Paul and Rosado-Serrano (2019). We organized our recommendations with particular attention to the contrast between Chinese and Western markets, acknowledging that the technological infrastructure, platform ecosystems, and regulatory environments differ significantly across regions. These contextual differences are likely to influence consumer behavior in live streaming e-commerce. Moreover, cultural distinctions-such as values, norms, and shopping motivations-can lead to heterogeneous patterns of impulse buying across countries (Cakanlar & Nguyen, 2019; Mooij & Hofstede, 2002). Accordingly, our agenda outlines how alternative theoretical perspectives, consumer characteristics, and methodological approaches can be employed to address these limitations and extend the field's scope beyond China. Table 6 presents a structured summary of the key research directions proposed for future studies, organized along the TCCM dimensions.

#### 4.2.1. Research context

A significant gap identified in the reviewed literature is the lack of differentiation between social media platforms and e-commerce platforms when examining impulse buying behavior in live streaming contexts. This distinction is critical, as these platforms differ in their core functions, user interfaces, and consumer engagement strategies, which likely shape viewer motivations and behavioral responses (Wongkitrungrueng et al., 2020). For instance, audiences on social media platforms tend to engage with live streaming content primarily for entertainment and emotional gratification (Bai et al., 2015). These motivations may amplify socially driven impulse buying. Conversely, viewers on e-commerce platforms are typically guided by more utilitarian motivations, such as searching for product information, comparing prices, or making direct purchases. In such contexts, impulse buying may be more strongly influenced by the efficiency of product presentation and transactional convenience (Lee & Wu, 2017). This distinction is particularly relevant given that e-commerce platforms are more deeply embedded within China's live streaming ecosystem. In contrast, in Western markets, the most rapidly growing live streaming e-commerce channels are hybrid platforms-social media platforms that have recently integrated e-commerce features. On these platforms, impulse buying is likely fueled by a combination of social interactivity, and transactional convenience (Zafar et al., 2021). Therefore, future research should explore platform-specific dynamics, recognizing that the motivations for engaging with live streaming content-and, consequently, the responses to marketing stimuli-may vary substantially depending on the type of platform. Differentiating between these platform types can offer more nuanced insights into the mechanisms driving impulse buying and inform platform-specific strategies for marketers and retailers.

Moreover, while a few studies have begun to investigate industry-specific contexts (e.g., Alam et al., 2023), there remains limited understanding of how product categories or industry types shape impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce. This represents an important research gap, as different industries may attract audiences with distinct motivations, expectations, and engagement patterns. Initial evidence regarding the moderating role of product type (Kong et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2024) suggests that consumers may respond differently to external stimuli depending on whether the product is, for instance, a search good, experience good, or hedonic vs. utilitarian in nature. These findings underscore the need for future studies to systematically explore variations across industry verticals, such as fashion, electronics, beauty, tourism, or philanthropy, to uncover category-specific dynamics of impulse buying in live streaming contexts.

#### 4.2.2. Theoretical extensions

Although the S-O-R framework has proven highly useful for understanding impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce, as discussed in previous sections, overreliance on a single theoretical lens may constrain the field's conceptual development. To advance a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of impulse buying, future research would benefit from incorporating complementary theoretical perspectives that capture different dimensions of the consumer decision-making process. One promising avenue is the integration of the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) (Venkatesh & Davis, 2000), which focuses on perceived usefulness and ease of use as key drivers of technology adoption. This model is particularly relevant for platforms and markets where live streaming is still emerging, such as Western e-commerce environments. For instance, marketplaces like Amazon and fashion retailers like Zara have only recently begun implementing live streaming features in Western markets. Combining TAM with the S-O-R framework can enrich our understanding by accounting for the technical acceptance of live streaming interfaces, in addition to the emotional and cognitive mechanisms emphasized by S-O-R. Such integration would allow researchers to explore how technological affordances, emotional reactions, and social interactions jointly shape impulse buying behavior in live streaming contexts (Pavlou, 2003).

Another valuable theoretical perspective that can be integrated with the S-O-R framework is Cue Utilization Theory. This theory posits that individuals rely on environmental cues to simplify decision-making, particularly when facing time constraints or limited information (Zhu et al., 2020). In complex environments such as live streaming e-commerce, where numerous stimuli operate simultaneously, consumers often narrow their focus to a smaller subset of salient cues to guide their behavior. Cue Utilization Theory is especially relevant in mature markets-such as China-where live streaming e-commerce is well-established and consumers have developed watching strategies and heuristics over time. In such contexts, users may selectively attend to trusted streamers, prominent promotions, or platform features that have proven reliable in previous experiences. By integrating this theory with S-O-R, researchers can better examine how environmental stimuli interact with individual traits, preferences, and cognitive shortcuts to influence impulse buying. This combined approach offers a richer analytical lens for understanding not only which cues are most influential, but also how and why consumers prioritize certain types of stimuli in live streaming contexts.

#### 4.2.3. Characteristics

Our systematic literature review has identified a broad range of characteristics influencing impulse buying behavior, both in relation to the various types of stimuli (e.g., marketing, platform, streamer) and organism-related factors (e.g., cognitive, affective, personality traits). These characteristics interact in complex ways depending on the platform, industry, and consumer profile. Therefore, future research should adopt a context-sensitive approach when selecting the characteristics to be analyzed.

Cultural differences play a significant role in shaping impulse buying behavior in live streaming e-commerce. In community-oriented cultures such as China, consumers are particularly susceptible to group interactions, discount-driven environments, and persuasive strategies employed by streamers, resulting in heightened conformity and impulsivity in purchase decisions. Moreover, social presence has been shown to enhance utilitarian attitudes in China, where purchasing decisions are guided not only by practical benefits but also by emotional satisfaction (Ni & Ueichi, 2024). In contrast, in individualistic cultures such as those of Western countries, purchasing decisions are less influenced by group norms and more reflective of autonomous, spontaneous behaviors. In these contexts, consumers often exhibit lower emotional restraint and place greater value on immediate gratification (Kacen & Lee, 2002), making them particularly responsive to the temporary emotional triggers present in live shopping environments. In the United States, for instance, consumers are more influenced by hedonic attitudes, emphasizing entertainment value, streamer credibility, and engaging content (Ni & Ueichi, 2024). Furthermore, time pressure and limited-time discounts, commonly used in live streaming, tend to amplify impulse buying by accelerating decision-making in cultures that favor quick emotional responses (Ni & Ueichi, 2024). Interestingly, although social presence also influences viewing intention in the U.S., its effect is hedonic rather than utilitarian, underscoring the need to differentiate cultural responses to similar stimuli. Additionally, it is essential for future research to explore the interaction effects between streamers' personal characteristics (e.g., attractiveness, expertise, credibility) and consumers' emotional drives across different cultural contexts. Such investigations would deepen our understanding of how emotional interactions with streamers trigger impulse buying under diverse cultural frameworks.

While our review identified a wide range of stimuli and organism-related variables that promote impulse buying, it also revealed a notable scarcity of factors that serve to attenuate such behavior (e.g., Gao et al., 2022). This imbalance highlights a critical gap in the literature. Future research is needed to explore which types of stimuli may have a suppressing or moderating effect on impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce. Additionally, greater attention should be given to identifying the internal mechanisms-such as cognitive regulation, self-control, or decision fatigue-that may enhance consumers' resilience to constant buying appeals.

Consumer resistance research (Roux, 2007) suggests that impulse buying can be inhibited by a range of cognitive and affective factors. In the context of livestreaming e-commerce, where fast-paced and highly engaging content encourages rapid decision-making, the activation of cognitive inhibitors is particularly important. A critical factor is perceived risk; consumers who are cautious about product quality, data security, or potential fraud are more likely to engage in careful evaluation, thereby mitigating impulse buying (Zhang, Cheng, & Huang, 2022). Importantly, perceived risk is multidimensional and may vary in salience depending on the product category or market context. For instance, performance risk may be more influential for utilitarian products, while social risk can be expected to play a greater role in the purchase of hedonic goods. Furthermore, cultural factors significantly shape the impact of perceived risk. In high uncertainty avoidance cultures, such as Japan or Germany, perceived risk tends to exert a stronger inhibitory effect on impulse buying (Park et al., 2012). In contrast, in low uncertainty avoidance cultures, like the United States, consumers may be more tolerant of risk and thus more prone to spontaneous purchases (Mitchell & Vassos, 1998). Beyond this, collectivistic cultures are more likely to be influenced by social risk, while individualistic cultures may place greater emphasis on data privacy risks (Zheng, 2017).

As consumer awareness of persuasive marketing techniques increases-such as scarcity appeals and influencer-driven manipulation-there is a corresponding rise in resistance behaviors, fostered through skepticism, critical evaluation, and cognitive control (Roux, 2007). One notable example of such cognitive control is the Zhong Yong tendency, a Confucian-based concept emphasizing balance, moderation, and harmony, which has been shown to help consumers manage conflicting desires and reduce impulsive responses to persuasive stimuli (Gao et al., 2022). However, as Zhong Yong is culturally specific to Chinese philosophical traditions, it is essential to identify conceptual equivalents or functionally similar constructs suitable for application in Western markets-such as cognitive restraint, deliberative thinking, or regulatory focus. In parallel, affective inhibition also plays a critical role in resisting impulse buying. One key mechanism is consumer vulnerability awareness. While high vulnerability may heighten susceptibility to emotional appeals, awareness of this vulnerability can trigger self-protective responses (Zhang et al., 2024). These responses may include delaying purchases, critically evaluating promotional messages, or seeking verification, all of which help mitigate impulsive behaviors in emotionally charged live streaming environments. In sum, future research should explore the cognitive and affective inhibitors of impulse buying not only in culturally relevant terms but also through cross-cultural conceptual adaptations. Doing so would contribute to a more balanced understanding of consumer behavior in live streaming e-commerce-one that accounts not only for impulsive tendencies but also for the psychological mechanisms that enable resistance.

Demographic factors have been shown to significantly influence impulse buying behavior in live streaming e-commerce (Huang et al., 2024). However, current research in this area remains limited in terms of audience segmentation, often lacking a comprehensive demographic perspective. As Lin et al. (2023) emphasized, there is a critical need for studies employing rigorous stratified sampling methods to ensure representative coverage of key variables such as age, gender, and education level. A common limitation in the existing literature is the overrepresentation of younger consumers (Yan et al., 2022). Given that different generations display distinct consumption behaviors, levels of technological adoption, and engagement patterns in live streaming e-commerce (McKinsey, 2023), future research should explore how generational differences-such as those between Gen Z, Millennials, Gen $\mathrm{X}$ ,and Boomers-influence the susceptibility to impulse buying within this context. While a few studies have examined gender differences in impulse buying during live streaming (e.g., Fu & Hsu, 2023), the results remain inconclusive. Prior literature suggests that gender may influence factors such as shopping convenience, perceived information usefulness (Okazaki & Mendez, 2013), concerns over security and privacy (Sebastianelli et al., 2008), and responses to time scarcity and emotional appeals (Chetioui and Bouzidi, 2023). These factors, in turn, can moderate impulse buying tendencies. Overall, to provide a more nuanced and generalizable understanding of impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce, future studies could incorporate and analyze key demographic variables-i.e., age, gender, income, and education level-as both moderators and segmentation criteria. This will enhance the ability to tailor theoretical models and marketing strategies to specific consumer profiles.

While the immersive nature of live streaming significantly enhances consumer engagement (Lv et al., 2022), it also raises important ethical concerns. These include the potential for reduced consumer autonomy, emotional manipulation, and pressured decision-making, particularly when persuasive tactics are used without transparency or safeguards (Wang et al., 2023). As live streaming environments become increasingly sophisticated in their ability to stimulate impulsive behavior, there is a growing need for greater accountability and ethical scrutiny in how these persuasive strategies are designed and deployed. Future research should explore consumers' ethical evaluations of commonly used persuasive techniques in live streaming e-commerce-such as scarcity appeals, social proof, or time pressure-and examine how these perceptions influence consumer trust, satisfaction, and long-term loyalty. Such inquiry would allow scholars to categorize persuasive techniques based on their perceived ethicality and determine whether certain psychological triggers are more likely to be viewed as manipulative or exploitative. Ultimately, this line of research can inform the development of ethical guidelines for responsible live streaming practices, helping platforms and marketers strike a balance between effective engagement and consumer protection. This would contribute not only to the academic understanding of impulse buying but also to the sustain-ability and credibility of live streaming as a commercial channel.

Finally, the continued expansion and globalization of live streaming presents promising opportunities to investigate cross-border e-commerce within this emerging context (Liu et al., 2024). Given China's pioneering role in both the e-commerce and live streaming industries, an important avenue for future research is to assess whether and how Chinese-origin practices and influencers shape consumer behavior in Western markets. In this regard, cultural factors such as ethnocentrism and cosmopolitanism may play a pivotal role in shaping impulse buying behavior. Ethnocentric consumers, who exhibit a preference for domestic products and culturally familiar figures, may be more responsive to local streamers and national branding cues. Conversely, cosmopolitan consumers, characterized by openness to global cultures, may respond more favorably to foreign products and international streamers (Prince et al., 2020).

#### 4.2.4. Methodological advances

To date, the majority of research on impulse buying in e-commerce live streaming relies on single-method studies based on questionnaire data. While this approach offers practical advantages, it also presents limitations due to the subjective nature of self-reported data, which may introduce biases related to personal perceptions or social desirability (Chen, Wang, Hung, & Hsueh, 2022). These limitations can restrict the scope and validity of the findings. Therefore, to better capture the complexity and real-time dynamics of consumer behavior in live streaming contexts, methodological diversification is needed.

Future studies should embrace experimental and quasi-experimental designs, which remain largely underutilized in the field. Our review identified only one study employing such methodology (Kong et al., 2023). Even when using scenario-based descriptions, experimental designs offer a more robust means of isolating and measuring the effects of specific stimuli. Moreover, experiments that simulate live streaming environments-for instance, by using video content rather than static text-can yield findings that more closely approximate actual consumer behavior, enhancing the ecological validity of impulse buying research in this context.

<!-- Meanless: 14-->




<!-- Meanless: Y. Li et al. Computers in Human Behavior Reports 19 (2025) 100676-->

Beyond ad hoc questionnaires and experimental designs, longitudinal studies are essential for understanding how impulse buying behavior evolves over time, particularly with repeated exposure to livestreaming stimuli (Alam et al., 2023). Such research could help identify which stimuli have enduring effects and which tend to dilute with time. It is plausible that the influence of certain stimuli on personal traits, such as trust, may fluctuate based on factors like prior experience, perceived saturation, or changing viewer expectations. This approach is especially relevant in mature markets like China, where consumers engage with live streaming e-commerce more frequently and may exhibit dynamic behavioral patterns over time.

Regardless of regional context, future studies should explore biometric methods, such as eye-tracking technology, to better understand the visual attention patterns of consumers during live streaming sessions and their connection to impulse buying. Eye-tracking can reveal where users focus their gaze-whether on product displays, promotional cues, the streamer's face, or chat messages- and help identify which elements are most effective in capturing attention and prompting purchases (Kim & Lee, 2021). When combined with emotion recognition tools, eye-tracking insights can provide a deeper understanding of how visual and emotional stimuli interact to influence impulsive behavior (Chen et al., 2022b).

Finally, multi-method studies are strongly encouraged to capture the complexity of impulse buying behavior in live streaming contexts. Combining real-time data on viewer interaction and audience feedback-analyzed through data mining and machine learning techniques (Chen et al., 2024)-with questionnaire-based insights can help explain consumer reactions as they unfold during live sessions. This approach is particularly valuable in mature markets like China, where audiences are more engaged and behaviors are well-formed. In contrast, for regions or industries where live streaming is still emerging, combining qualitative methods such as content analysis, interviews, and focus groups can provide a richer and more nuanced understanding of the drivers of impulse buying (Liu et al., 2024).

## 5. Limitations

In conducting our systematic literature review, we applied stringent inclusion and exclusion criteria, which-while ensuring methodological rigor-also introduce certain limitations that must be acknowledged. By restricting our analysis to peer-reviewed academic articles that met clearly defined standards, the scope of the review was necessarily limited. First, we only included studies published in English, which may have led to the exclusion of relevant research conducted in other languages, particularly in regions such as China where significant scholarly work may be published using Chinese as main language. Second, we focused exclusively on studies that examined impulse buying within the specific context of live streaming e-commerce, thereby excluding broader research that may have addressed purchase intentions or related behaviors in this setting. Third, our review was limited to articles published in journals indexed in Web of Science and Scopus, ensuring a high standard of academic credibility but potentially overlooking valuable insights from non-indexed journals, conference proceedings, or industry reports. Therefore, while our methodological approach enhances the reliability and academic contribution of the review, these inherent constraints should be taken into account when considering the generalizability, comprehensiveness, and applicability of our findings.

## 6. Conclusions

Given the growing relevance of impulse buying in e-commerce live streaming and the scarcity and fragmentation of existing research, the primary objective of this study was to review and organize the extant literature on the topic. Through a systematic search of academic databases, 40 peer-reviewed studies were identified and analyzed. This enabled us to examine the literature in terms of publication outlets, research contexts, theoretical frameworks, research approaches and methods, and key factors influencing impulse buying behavior. Particular attention was given to the classification of these factors using the S-O-R framework, which emerged as the dominant theoretical lens in the reviewed studies. This framework incorporates both antecedent stimuli and mediating organism variables, offering a comprehensive view of the mechanisms underlying impulse buying in live streaming contexts. By identifying well-established relationships as well as underexplored paths, we developed an integrative model that synthesizes current knowledge. Lastly, we proposed a future research agenda focused on expanding resarch contexts and theoretical perspectives, exploring new variables and improving methodological diversity. Overall, this review offers a more cohesive and structured understanding of impulse buying in live streaming e-commerce and provides valuable directions for advancing research in this rapidly evolving field.
